## 📌 Overview
This portfolio contains all of my weekly lab work for CN6005 Artificial Intelligence.  
I used **Google Colab** for coding and GitHub to keep everything organized.

Each week includes:
- My notes  
- Code used in the lab  
- What I learned  
- Experiments and results

# 📝 **Week 1 – Python Basics & EDA**

This week I practiced simple Python tasks like loops, lists, variables, and basic data exploration.  
I also loaded the Iris dataset and made visualizations like:
- Histograms  
- Boxplots  
- Scatter plots  
- Correlation heatmap  

It helped me understand how Python handles data and how to explore a dataset step by step.

---

# 📝 **Week 2 – More Pandas & Visualisation**

I continued learning pandas and practiced EDA more deeply.  
I learned:
- Grouping  
- Summary statistics  
- DataFrame manipulation  
- Cleaning basic data  

This week made me a lot more comfortable reading and understanding datasets.

---

# 🧪 **Week 3 – Classification Models**

## 🔹 1. Logistic Regression (Binary Classification – Diabetes)
I trained a logistic regression model on an imbalanced diabetes dataset.  
I used:
- Train/test split  
- Confusion matrix  
- Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score  
- ROC curve  

This was the first time I understood why imbalanced data affects accuracy.

---

## 🔹 2. Multiclass Classification – Iris Dataset
I trained a multiclass classifier using Logistic Regression.  
This dataset was easier to understand because it is clean and balanced.

I learned the difference between **binary vs multiclass** models.

---

# 🧠 **Week 4 – Perceptron & ANN**

## 🔹 1. Perceptron
I implemented a basic perceptron model and saw how weights change during training.  
This helped me understand linear classifiers.

## 🔹 2. ANN for Binary Classification
I created a small Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using Keras.  
It had:
- Input layer  
- Hidden layer  
- Output layer  

This week I understood how neural networks learn from data.

---

# 🖼️ **Week 5 – CNN Digit Classification & Grad-CAM**

## 🔹 1. CNN for MNIST
I trained a CNN to classify handwritten digits (28×28 grayscale images).  
Then I changed:
- Number of convolution layers  
- Filter sizes  

I compared accuracy changes to understand model complexity.

## 🔹 2. GradCAM (XAI)
I used GradCAM to see which part of the image the CNN was focusing on.  
This helped me see how Deep Learning models make decisions.

---

# 🔍 **Week 6 – Clustering (KMeans)**

This week, I worked on KMeans clustering using the **Country dataset**.  
I used `health` and `income` columns to cluster countries.

I performed:
- KMeans clustering  
- Scatter plots  
- Elbow method  
- Silhouette score  

This was the first unsupervised learning algorithm I used, and I found it very interesting.

---

# 🎯 **Conclusion**
Over these weeks, I learned:
- Python basics  
- How to explore data  
- Classification models  
- Neural networks  
- CNNs  
- Explainable AI  
- Clustering  

I feel more confident now in understanding machine learning concepts and running experiments.
